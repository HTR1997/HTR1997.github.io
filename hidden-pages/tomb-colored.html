        Trigonometry<br>
        -The study of triangles.<br>
        I never really understood trig until it was taught using circle.<br>
        Remembering opp over hyp and using socatoah never made any sense.<br>
        Teaching in this way is like giving a surface reading of a book.<br>
        Too much is left out for the reader to understand what the plot is.<br>
        <br><br>
        Black lines are unit length.<br>
        Red lines have length sine.<br>
        Blue lines have length cosine.<br><br>
        Orangle lines have length cosecant (or 1/sine).<br>
        Light blue lines have length secant (or 1/cosine).<br><br>
        Purple lines have length tangent (or sine/cosine).<br>
        Light purple lines have length of cotangent (or 1/tangent).<br>
        <br><br>
        I still have more I want to add to this graphic.<br>
        -Better explanations for how each trig function can be derived.<br>
        -Evolving map of all this information.<br>
        -Inclusion of these trig identities in written form.<br>
        -Showing the relationship between arc-length and angles.<br>
