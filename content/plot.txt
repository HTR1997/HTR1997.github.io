I'm no author. Words are hard, thats why I'm trying to use so many pictures for this thing.

Introduction
	Hello, hope its going well. The inspiration for this site came from a moment when I was re-learning complex analysis. I got to a problem in the textbook I was using and found that I could not recall sin(π/6) or some similar table value. So I decided to re-re-learn some of the math basics. <br>
        My goal is to share some visualizations of trigonomitry ideas from the lense of the circle. Its the only perspective that makes sense to me and is a much fuller representation of what I now feel like trig is. <br>


Circles
        To your right is a circle. Its a circle because all the points that make it up are the same distance away from its center. The radius is also drawn, you can move it around with the mouse. Have some fun spinning the line around while things are simple. Try to remember this when feeling when it gets complicate.


Arcs & Angles
	Angles are important in triganometry and usually associated with triangles.<br>
        An arc is a portion of the circumfrence of a circle. Each of the gren lines is an arc of a circle of different radius. <br>
        The associated angle for each of these arcs is <br>
        The reason angles are so useful is that they can describe the idea of the distance around a circle for any sized circle. If you go π radians around a circle, you have gone halfway around it, regardless of the actual distance.
        DEF: Lengths_of_arc/Radius = angle <br>
        TODO: Add some values showing that the angle is the same for all arcs. <br>
