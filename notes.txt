#Going to need to make some sort of choice on what to do with this site
#One (good) idea is to have a page of trig identities that link 
#	to their respective images

#Still want to do the map of idents starting with
# e^j(theta) -> map to each page
# connected with little wavy lines


#Also need to figre out a git structure so we don't just
#	have all these pages flowing around


#Also want to have a way to rotate and fill in the color 
#	in a non instant way (ie so going 2pi rad around fills the circle
	and going further un-fills it)
