      <h1> Triangles and PI </h1>
        <p>
          Most of you will have first learnt about Sine and Cosine in a geometry or a pre-calc class. In this context the sin and cos functions are used to describe the ratio of a leg of a right triangle and its hypotenuse. This one of the uses of sin and cos and is very "to the point" with it. These classes often start by using degrees as the unit for the trig functions but eventualy move to using radians. At this point PI becomes involved in what might feel like a very arbitrary way.

     <!--p>
        Math is a very abstract subject. That is part of its design. But sometimes it is to difficult to see how things relate.
        That is why i am making this website. The goal is to take some ideas and, rather than try and make them less abstract, 
        find a way to keep the abstraction but show how they relate to other ideas in an obvious or simple way.
